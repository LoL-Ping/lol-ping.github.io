        <p>LoL Ping Checker is a tiny LoL ping app
            that lets you find the ping within your machine and <a
                href="https://play.na.leagueoflegends.com/en_US">LoL</a> servers.

            The idea behind League of Legends is that the player is a Summoner who controls their chosen Champion.
            Forming teams, they battle for dominance and victory, leveling up their characters and buying items.
        </p>

        <p>The game itself features a few different modes of play, such as  the widely popularized Summoner’s Rift
            where two teams of five players battle to destroy the enemy base, called the Nexus, or the more casual mode
            ARAM (all random all mid) where again, five players battle a team of another five, except that the map is
            condensed into a single lane and the champions are randomized from each players available pool. There are
            additional seasonal modes, as well as the newly established Teamfight Tactics (TFT) mode which is more of a
            strategy board game.</p>
